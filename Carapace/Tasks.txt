! trace lines clip out sometimes depending on zoom level ... related to the zoom you created them at originally or something?

- ability to toggle vanishing points on/off without deleting them (good for copying to individual layers in Photoshop)

- force the first 3 vanishing points to be pure red/green/blue because then at least people could use the channels list in Photoshop to create layers easily

- CTRL+ALT+C should copy just the selected vanishing point to the clipboard

- add an ability to change the color of the lines depending on the plane
